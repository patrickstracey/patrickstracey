## Hello! My name is Patrick ðŸ‘‹
I've managed dev teams and product roadmaps as an Engineering Manager, written code as a Front-end Developer, and hired Design and Product teams from scratch. Currently I am spending most of my dev time doing full stack Typescript (Angular/NestJs), but I also have experience building web apps with Python (Flask/Django), silly games with Unity (C#), low poly modeling with Blender, and UX prototypes with Figma.

### What Am I Doing Professionally?
 Currently I am working as a Software Developer at Vehlo focused primarily on the front-end of the stack utilzing Angular 18+, GraphQL, Spring Boot, and an NX monorepo. I am always excited about opportunities to help build thoughtful, high performing teams who are used to doing more with less, or jumping into a full-time individual contributor role where I can improve my skillset.
